The **VISA Anywhere** project addresses COVID-19 by promoting **contactless digital payments**, enabling users to preorder essentials from local merchants while maintaining social distancing. By integrating **VISA APIs**, the web app connects users with nearby **VISA Card-accepting merchants** and displays **wait times** to manage visits safely. It also offers **weather insights**, home delivery options, and flexible ordering time slots, enhancing convenience and safety for consumers.
