Hello! I’m Harsh Jangid, from Kishangarh, Ajmer, Rajasthan—famous for its beautiful marble and rich cultural heritage.

I am a creative, dedicated, and goal-oriented individual with strong moral values and ethics. As a full stack developer and Software Engineer 2 at Microsoft, specializing in Azure solutions, I have experience in both backend and frontend development as well as cloud solutions. I bring a high-energy level, honed communication skills, strong organizational abilities, and meticulous attention to detail.

I graduated with a B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from [IIT-BHU (Varanasi)](https://iitbhu.ac.in/) in May 2021.
